         * âœ… For ECC (EC_v1), decrypt the data key using AESâ€“256 (id-aes256-GCM 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.46), with an initialization vector of 16 null bytes and no associated authentication data.

         *
         * ðŸ‘€ After you complete Step 4, the payment data in the data value of the payment token structure is decrypted. Use the decrypted payment data and information you have about the transaction to validate that transaction.
         *
         * ðŸ‘€ Step 5: Confirm that you haven't already credited this payment by verifying that no payment with the same transactionId shows as processed. For efficiency, consider only those payments with a transaction time thatâ€™s within the 5-minute time window of the current transactionId, as explained in the last bullet point of Step 1.
         *
         * ðŸ‘€  Step 6: Verify the transaction details using information from the merchant about the Apple Pay payment request and other transaction information:
         *
         * ðŸ‘€ Check that the currencyCode matches the currency code in the original Apple Pay payment request.
         *
         * ðŸ‘€ Check that the transactionAmount is correct, as compared with the total charge of the transaction.
         *
         * ðŸ‘€ Check that the applicationData field matches the hash of the data the original payment request used, and that the data is correct. For example, check that an order number in the data from the original payment request is the order number to which you, the payment processor, are applying this payment. For more information, see applicationData in PKPaymentRequest. For transactions that initiate in Apple Pay on the Web, see applicationData in ApplePayPaymentRequest and applicationData in ApplePayRequest.
         *
         * âœ… Step 7: If the signature is valid, the hash values match, and your transaction validation passes, use the decrypted payment data to process the payment. Otherwise, ignore the transaction.
